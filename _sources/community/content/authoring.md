# How do I Author and Preview Content using Jupyter Book?

This guide shows you how to author and preview content using Jupyter Book within your 2i2c Managed JupyterHub Service.

```{note}
This use case is currrently for authoring and previewing local content only. A separate guide will follow describing how to deploy and publish Jupyter Book for other domains using the [Community Showcase Hub](https://github.com/2i2c-org/community-showcase) template. 
```

## Set up Jupyter Book

1. From your hub homepage, select the server option you require for your work and select the `Handbook Authoring` image from the dropdown selection box.

```{margin} Server options
We recommend minimal CPU resources since authoring content is not computationally intensive.
```

2. Once your JupyterHub service has launched, open a `Terminal` from the launcher.

3. In the terminal, use the command

```bash
$ jupyter-book create mynewbook
```

to create a **template** for your Jupyter Book documentation. This creates a new folder called `mynewbook` in your home directory, which will appear in the file explorer to the left-hand side. The contents of this template folder are as follows:

```shell
mynewbook/
├── _config.yml
├── _toc.yml
├── intro.md
├── logo.png
├── markdown-notebooks.md
├── markdown.md
├── notebooks.ipynb
├── references.bib
└── requirements.txt
```

The `_config.yml` and `_toc.yml` files are essential to the Jupyter Book system.

### Configuration (`_config.yml`)

The `_config.yml` is a YAML configuration file for setting various options for your Jupyter Book (see [Jupyter Book docs – Configuration reference](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/customize/config.html) for a definitive list of options).

For the purpose of authoring a Jupyter Book on a 2i2c Managed JupyterHub service, we can leave the default settings as they are. At the very least, you may want to change the following:

```yaml
title                       : My Community Showcase Handbook  # The title of the book. Will be placed in the left navbar.
author                      : 2i2c  # The author of the book
copyright                   : "2024"  # Copyright year to be placed in the footer
logo                        : "logo.png"  # A path to the book logo
```

```{dropdown} Enabling extensions
And here's my dropdown content
```

### Table of contents (`_toc.yml`)

This YAML file defines the chapter and sub-chapter structure of your Jupyter Book. The current template `_toc.yml` looks like this:

```yaml
format: jb-book 
root: intro
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks
- file: markdown-notebooks
```

where the files listed above refer to the sample `markdown.md`, `notebooks.ipynb` and `markdown-notebooks.md` files contained within the template folder (written **without** the filename extensions).

```{note}
When adding/removing files to/from your book, remember to update the `_toc.yml` accordingly.
```

For a definitive guide to structuring your Jupyter Book, including parts, sections and custom titles, please refer to the [Jupyter Book docs – Structure the Table of Contents](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/structure/toc.html).

## Edit content

The content of your book can consist of the following file types:

- Markdown `.md` – a type of markup language. Jupyter Book supports [MyST Markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/myst.html).
- Jupyter notebook `.ipynb` – the standard computational notebook format.
- MyST Markdown Notebooks `.md` – text-based Jupyter notebook written in MyST markdown.
- reStructuredText `.rst` – a Sphinx-supported flavour of Markdown (see [How Jupyter Book and Sphinx relate to one another](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html)).

`````{admonition} Exercise
:class: tip
Try editing the sample files in the template folder to familiarise yourself with the different file types. If you are unfamiliar with MyST Markdown, then try formatting some text using this [guide](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html).
`````

## Build and preview your Jupyter Book

:width: 100%
:::

(step-1)=
1. From a terminal, execute the command

```shell
$ jupyter-book build mynewbook
```

to build your Jupyter Book, which generates HTML files from your content and places them in the `mynewbook/_build/html/` folder.

2. Open a **new** terminal and navigate to the HTML folder using the command

```shell
$ cd mynewbook/_build/html
```

3. Run a simple Python webserver with the command

```shell
$ python -m http.server
```

4. Preview your documentation website in an iFrame within JupyterLab

```{margin} Preview in your browser
Alternatively, you can open this URL directly in your browser to preview your documentation website.
```

  - By clicking `View > Activate Command Palette` in the menu bar
  - Search for the `Open iFrame` command 
  - Copy and paste the following URL (**edit as required**) into the `Open Site` textbox
  
  ```
  https://<your-hub-url>/user/<your-username>/proxy/8000/index.html
  ```

### Edit and rebuild

After editing content files in your Jupyter Book, you will need to re-build the HTML pages using the command from [Step 1](step-1), and then refresh your iFrame/website to preview your changes.

````{tip}
If your book's Table of Contents doesn't update after changing the `_toc.yml` file, try:

```console
$ jupyter-book build --all mynewbook
```

which rebuilds *all* files and not just modified files  only.
